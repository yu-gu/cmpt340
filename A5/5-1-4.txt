Problem 1.
(a)No
london cannot be assigned to paris as two different facts.


(b)Yes
mgu{
X=X1,
Y=Y1,
Z=Z1
}

(c)No.
letter and word cannot be unified because these are two differenc facts.


(d)No.
One rule is a complex term unify if they have the same functor and arity (number of arguments)
In this case,  noun(alpha) has one functor but alpha does not.


(e)Yes.
student('student').
String(student)can be assigned to fact as a value.


(f)No.
X cannot be assigned to both a and b.
It violates the condition of unification that "The variable instantiations are compatible"


(g)Yes.
mgu{
X=Z,
Z=b
}


(h)No.
Z can not be assigned to both c and b.
It violates the condition of unification that "The variable instantiations are compatible"


(i)Yes.
mgu{
X=d,
Z=b
}

(j)Yes.
mgu{
Z = C = 17+17 = 34,
A = B = D = E = 17.
}
